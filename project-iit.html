    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]During my summer internship, I delved into deep learning and contributed to an agricultural project using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to boost agricultural productivity[cite: 74, 75]. The core objective was to apply image classification techniques to predict plant leaf count.

    <h2>Key Contributions & Technical Detail</h2>

    <h3>Model Development and Accuracy</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>Developed and fine-tuned a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** for image-based plant leaf count prediction[cite: 32].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>Achieved a classification accuracy of **92%**[cite: 32].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data and Model Robustness</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>Boosted model performance and robustness by **8%** via a custom image enhancement algorithm using **histogram equalization**[cite: 33, 76].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>Automated and scaled data augmentation pipelines within Keras, resulting in a **20% reduction in total model training time**[cite: 36].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Model Optimization</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>Applied **K-fold cross-validation** and **grid search** to fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance, enriching my machine learning expertise[cite: 37, 77].</li>
    </ul>
