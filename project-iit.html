    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]During my summer internship under Professor Pabitra Mitra, I contributed to an agricultural project focused on **boosting productivity** by applying advanced machine learning techniques[cite: 17, 18]. This work involved the practical application of deep learning for **image classification** to predict plant leaf count.

    <h2>Key Contributions & Technical Detail</h2>

    <h3>Model Development and Accuracy</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>Developed and fine-tuned a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using popular frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for image-based plant leaf count prediction[cite: 8, 70].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>Achieved a high classification accuracy of **92%** on the model[cite: 70].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data and Model Robustness</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>To improve training dataset quality and boost model performance, I created a custom **image enhancement algorithm** using **histogram equalization**[cite: 19, 71].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>This preprocessing technique improved the model's overall **robustness and performance by 8%**[cite: 71].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>Automated and scaled data augmentation pipelines within Keras, resulting in a **20% reduction in total model training time**[cite: 72, 74].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Model Optimization</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>Applied rigorous model optimization techniques, including **K-fold cross-validation** and **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning, which enriched my machine learning expertise[cite: 20, 75].</li>
    </ul>
