    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]During my internship with the Admissions Department, I focused on improving administrative efficiency by tackling a fully manual, time-intensive document validation process[cite: 80]. [cite_start]I developed a tool to automate the generation and verification of Leaving Certificates, directly addressing a critical bottleneck in the admissions workflow[cite: 79].

    <h2>Key Contributions & Impact</h2>

    <h3>Process Automation with OCR</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>Developed an automation system in **Python** to handle the generation of Leaving Certificates[cite: 79].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>The system incorporated **Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to validate submitted documents (images and PDFs) against known records[cite: 79].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>This technical solution enabled the institute to completely replace the prior manual validation process[cite: 80].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Efficiency and Scale</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>The automation achieved a significant reduction in processing time by **80%**[cite: 80].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>The system demonstrated robustness by successfully processing more than **100 documents per day**[cite: 81].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>Overall, this improvement enhanced staff efficiency and accuracy within the department[cite: 81].</li>
    </ul>
