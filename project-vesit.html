    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]During my internship, I worked with the Admissions Department to solve a critical, time-intensive administrative bottleneck: the manual validation and generation of Leaving Certificates[cite: 71, 72]. [cite_start]My project focused on developing a tool to **automate this process**, creating a fully streamlined and error-reducing workflow[cite: 73].
    </p>

    <h2>Key Contributions & Impact</h2>

    <h3>Process Automation with OCR</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>Developed an end-to-end automation system in **Python** to handle the generation of Leaving Certificates[cite: 41].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>The system utilized **Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** for document verification, validating submitted documents, including images and PDFs[cite: 41, 72].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>This technical solution successfully replaced a fully manual validation process, significantly reducing human error[cite: 42].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Efficiency and Scale</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>The automation achieved a substantial reduction in staff processing time by **80%**[cite: 42].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>The system was deployed to production and successfully processed more than **100 documents per day**, improving staff efficiency and accuracy[cite: 43].</li>
    </ul>
