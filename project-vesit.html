    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]I developed a tool to automate the generation of Leaving Certificates in the Admissions Department, directly addressing a critical, fully manual document validation process[cite: 41, 42, 72]. [cite_start]This work introduced me to the value of using technology to streamline processes and reduce errors[cite: 73].

    <h2>Key Contributions & Impact</h2>

    <h3>Process Automation with OCR</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>Developed an automation system in **Python** that utilized **Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** for verifying submitted documents (images and PDFs)[cite: 41, 72].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>The system enabled the institute to completely replace the prior manual validation process[cite: 42].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Efficiency and Scale</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>The automation reduced overall processing time by **80%**[cite: 42].</li>
        [cite_start]<li>The system processed more than **100 documents per day**, substantially improving staff efficiency and accuracy[cite: 43].</li>
    </ul>
